Government of Canada CKAN Extension - Extension Ã  CKAN du Gouvernement du Canada

Team: Ian Ward, Ross Thompson, Peder Jakobsen, Denis Zgonjanin

Features:

* Forms and Validation for GoC Metadata Schema

  * complete, but planning to migrate to ckanext-scheming once it is ready

* Batch import of data

  * merged into ckanapi, will be removed from here shortly

Installation:

* Use open-data fork of CKAN, branch canada-v2.1

From a clean database you must run::

Configuration: development.ini or production.ini
------------------------------------------------

The CKAN ini file needs the following plugins for the registry server::

   ckan.plugins = stats googleanalytics canada_forms canada_internal canada_public canada_package wet_theme datastore recombinant

For the public server use only::

   ckan.plugins = stats googleanalytics canada_forms canada_public canada_package wet_theme

CKAN also needs to be able to find the licenses file for the license list
to be correctly populated::

   licenses_group_url = http://<ckan instance>/static/licenses.json

Users that don't belong to an Organization should not be allowed to create
datasets, without this setting the form will be presented but fail during
validation::

   ckan.auth.create_dataset_if_not_in_organization = false

We aren't using notification emails, so they need to be disabled::

   ckan.activity_streams_email_notifications = false

Additionally, we want to limit the search results page to 10 results per page::

   ckan.datasets_per_page = 10

To integrate Google Analytics::

   googleanalytics.id = UA-1010101-1 (your analytics account id)
   googleanalytics.account = Account name (i.e. data.gov.uk, see top level item at https://www.google.com/analytics)

For the public server, also set the Drupal portal URL::

   canada.portal_url = http://myserver.com

For the registry server set up recombinant configuration for ATI summaries::

   recombinant.tables = ckanext.canada:recombinant_tables.json


Configuration: Solr
----------------------

This extension uses a custom Solr schema based on the ckan 2.1 schema. You can find the schema in the root directory of the project.
Overwrite the default CKAN Solr schema with this one in order to enable search faceting over custom metadata fields.

You will need to rebuild your search index using::

   paster --plugin ckan search-index rebuild



Working with the API
--------------------

To view a raw dataset using the api, use the ``ckanapi`` command line tool, e.g.::

  ckanapi package_show id=0007a010-556d-4f83-bb8e-6e22dcc62e84


schema_description
------------------

The GoC Metadata Schema is available within the plugin by importing::

   from ckanext.canada.metadata_schema import schema_description

It is also available within the jinja2 templates as the variable
``schema_description``.

The ``schema_description`` object contains attributes:

``dataset_fields``
  an ordered list of `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_ of fields
  available in a dataset

``resource_fields``
  an ordered list of `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_ of fields
  available in each resource in a dataset

``dataset_sections``
  a list of dataset fields grouped into sections, dicts with ``'name'``
  and ``'fields'`` keys, currently used to separate fields across the
  dataset creation pages and group the geo fields together

``dataset_field_by_id``
  a dict mapping dataset field ids to their
  `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_

``resource_field_by_id``
  a dict mapping resource field ids to their
  `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_

``dataset_field_iter(include_existing=True, section=None)``
  returns a generator of (field id, language, field description) tuples
  where field ids generated includes ``*_fra`` fields.  both French
  and English versions of a field point use the same
  `field description <#field-descriptions>`_.
  language is ``'eng'``, ``'fra'`` or ``None`` for fields without
  separate language versions.
  ``include_existing=False`` would *exclude* standard CKAN fields and
  ``section`` may be used to limith the fields to the passed dataset
  section.

``resource_field_iter(include_existing=True)``
  returns a generator of (field id, language, field description) tuples
  where field ids generated includes ``*_fra`` fields.  both French
  and English versions of a field point use the same
  `field description <#field-descriptions>`_.
  language is ``'eng'``, ``'fra'`` or ``None`` for fields without
  separate language versions.
  ``include_existing=False`` would *exclude* standard CKAN fields.

``languages``
  ``['eng', 'fra']``, useful for keeping literal ``eng`` and ``fra``
  strings out of the source code

``vocabularies``
  a dict mapping CKAN tag vocabulary ids to their corresponding dataset
  field ids


Field Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dataset and resource field descriptions are dicts containing the following:

``'id'``
  the CKAN internal name for this field, e.g. ``"notes"``, ``"title"``, ...
  ; note that these do not include French versions of fields such as
  ``"notes_fra"``; if you need both language versions use the
  ``dataset_field_iter`` or ``resource_field_iter`` methods above

``'label'``
  ``{'eng': English field label, 'fra': French field label}``

``'description'``
  ``{'eng': English field description, 'fra': French field description}``

``'example'``
  ``{'eng': English example value, 'fra': French example value}``

``'existing'``
  ``True`` if this field exists in the default CKAN schema in at least
  one language, used by ``dataset_field_iter`` and ``resource_field_iter``
  to filter English fields when passed ``include_existing=False``

``'bilingual'``
  ``True`` if there are two separate versions of this field, one for
  English and one for French with ``"_fra"`` appended to the ``'id'``,
  ``False`` for fields that contain no language component or have both
  languages stored together in one field, e.g. choice fields

``'mandatory'``
  ``"all"`` if always required, ``"geo"`` if required for geo datasets,
  ``"raw"`` if required for raw datasets, ``None`` if not required

``'choices'``
  if this key exists then the user must select one of the choices
  in this list; the list contains dicts with the following:

  ``'eng'``
    English text for this choice to display to English users

  ``'fra'``
    French text for this choice to display to French users

  ``'key'``
    valid field value

  ``'id'``
    an id for this choice from the proposed choices list, if available

  ``'pilot_uuid'``
    correspongind UUID for this choice when importing pilot data

  ``'subject_ids'``
    topic_category choices only: this field contains a list of ids from the
    subject choices list that correspond to this topic_category choice

``'choices_by_pilot_uuid'``
  if ``'choices'`` exists then this will be a dict mapping pilot UUIDs
  to the choices dicts above

``'type'``
  one of the following values:

  ``'primary_key'``
    the id field

  ``'choice'``
    select one of the ``'choices'`` list above

  ``'calculated'``
    value determined by code in CKAN or this plugin, not for user-entry

  ``'fixed'``
    fixed value for all datasets, all datasets will use ``'example'`` value
    above

  ``'slug'``
    text suitable for use as part of a URL: lowercase Unicode characters and
    hyphens

  ``'text'``
    free-form text

  ``'tag_vocabulary'``
    allow selection of 0 or more values from ``'choices'`` list above

  ``'keywords'``
    free-form keywords in a string separated with commas; Unicode
    letter characters, hyphen (-) and single spaces between words are allowed

  ``'date'``
    iso8601 date: YYYY-MM-DD

  ``'boolean'``
    ``True`` or ``False`` (not strings, but strings are accepted when setting)

  ``'url'``
    fully qualified URL

  ``'integer'``
    integer value in base 10

  ``'image_url'``
    fully qualified URL to an image file (gif, png or jpg)

``'ui_options'``
  if present a list containing strings such as ``'disabled'`` or ``'hidden'``
  which affect the form presented to users entering datasets


Compiling the updated French localization strings
-------------------------------------------------

Each time you install or update this extension you need to install the
updated translations by running::

    bin/build-combined-ckan-mo.sh

This script overwrites the ckan French translations by combining it with
ours.

Linking with Drupal (Optional)
------------------------------

Data.gc.ca uses the Drupal web content management system to provide much of its content and to provide a means
for users to comment on and rate the data-sets found in the CKAN catalog. If using with Drupal, provide the database
connection string for the Drupal database in the CKAN configuration file::

    ckan.drupal.url =  postgresql://db_user:user_password/drupal_database

If this value is not defined, then the extension will not attempt to read from the Drupal database.

The installed Drupal site must have the opendata_package module enabled. In additional, 3 views are used by the
Drupal. Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary views in the Drupal database::

    create or replace view opendata_package_v as  select to_char(to_timestamp(c.changed::double precision),
        'YYYY-MM-DD'::text) AS changed, c.name, c.thread, f.comment_body_value, c.language, o.pkg_id FROM comment c
        JOIN field_data_comment_body f ON c.cid = f.entity_id
        JOIN opendata_package o ON (c.nid IN ( SELECT n.nid
        FROM node n
        WHERE n.nid = o.pkg_node_id and c.status = 1));

    create view opendata_package_rating_v as select avg(v.value)/25+1 as rating, p.pkg_id from opendata_package p
                 inner join votingapi_vote v on p.pkg_node_id = v.entity_id group by p.pkg_id;

    create or replace view opendata_package_count_v as select count(c.*), o.pkg_id from comment c
        inner join opendata_package o
        on o.pkg_node_id = c.nid and c.status = 1 group by o.pkg_id;

    alter view public.opendata_package_v owner to <db_user>;
    alter view public.opendata_package_rating_v owner to <db_user>;
    alter view public.opendata_package_count_v owner to <db_user>;

Substitute <db_user> with the appropriate SQL user account.

Automating ATI and PD Dataset Promotion from Registry to Portal (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section outlines the process of automating the promotion of ATI
and PD datasets from the Registry to the Portal through the invocation
of the ``bin/reg2portal.sh`` and ``bin/csv2solr.sh`` scripts.

*The Registry*

On the registry, the ``bin/reg2portal.sh`` script pushes specified
datasets to the registry's CKAN installation. It takes the following
parameters:

  ``CKAN-INI-FILE``
    The path to the configuration file of the CKAN registry installation

  ``PORTAL-URL``
    The URL of the CKAN public portal

  ``API-KEY``
    The API key to use in invoking the CKAN API to propagate ATI and PD
    datasets to the portal

  ``TARGET-DATASET:PACKAGE-ID ...``
    One or more space-separated and colon-delimited mappings
    (e.g. ``ati:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000``) between target
    datasets and their respective names or identifiers on the portal

  ``VIRTUAL-ENV-HOME`` (optional)
    If present, the root directory of the python virtual environment to
    activate, under which the script will operate

First, the execution of the script activates the virtual environment
if specified.

Then, it uses ckanext-recombinant to parse all target datasets from
its (JSON) recombinant tables file. For each such target dataset
mapped on the command line, the execution queries ckanext-recombinant
for its respective dataset types (e.g.; ati-none, ati-summaries).
The script calls ckanext-recombinant to combine CKAN content for
each of these dataset types into a temporary .csv file for promotion.

The script then calls, for each target dataset mapped on the command
line, the ``bin\reg2portal.py`` script, specifying:
* the CKAN configuration file
* the URL for the portal
* the API key
* the mapped identifier for the target dataset
* all paths to temporary combined .csv files germane to the target dataset

The ``bin\reg2portal.py`` script invokes the CKAN API to patch the
package by its specified identifier, clearing out existing resources
and uploading the combined .csv files to the portal in their stead.

Finally, the ``bin\reg2portal.sh`` script cleans up the temporary
files it created in its operations.

For the registry host, a sample crontab entry automating daily
ATI and PD propagation (specifying names for the datasets on the
registry, to a portal on host devubu3) follows:

    ``0 2 * * * /opt/open-data/ckanext-canada/bin/reg2portal.sh /opt/open-data/ckanext-canada/development.ini http://devubu3:5000 141d4974-7d48-47b9-a003-b09d5f8e7c3a ati:ati pd:pd /opt/venvs/env-ckan-2.1 >> /var/log/reg2portal.log 2>&1``

*The Portal*

On the portal, the ``bin/csv2solr.sh`` script rebuilds the configured
local solr core with the content of specified datasets from the local
CKAN installation. It takes the following parameters:

  ``CKAN-INI-FILE``
    The path to the configuration file of the CKAN portal installation

  ``TARGET-DATASET:PACKAGE-ID ...``
    One or more space-separated and colon-delimited mappings
    (e.g. ``pd:11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111``) between target
    datasets and their respective names or identifiers on the portal

  ``VIRTUAL-ENV-HOME`` (optional)
    If present, the root directory of the python virtual environment to
    activate, under which the script will operate

First, the execution of the script activates the virtual environment
if specified.

Then, uses ckanext-recombinant to parse all target datasets from
its (JSON) recombinant tables file. For each such target dataset
mapped on the command line, the script calls ckanext-canada to
locate its associated resources on the portal. The operation
downloads these resources and uses them to rebuild the target
dataset from them via ckanext-canada.

Finally, the script cleans up the temporary files it created
in its operations.

For the portal host, a sample crontab entry automating daily
ATI and PD solr core rebuild (specifying identifiers for the
datasets on the portal) follows:

    ``0 2 * * * /opt/open-data/ckanext-canada/bin/csv2solr.sh /opt/open-data/ckanext-canada/development.ini ati:636893c9-e4b4-451c-b652-571f2f1349dd pd:ca8f5f4b-b5d8-4884-a8d5-4a87dca4f6f6 /opt/venvs/env-ckan-2.3 >> /var/log/csv2solr.log 2>&1``
