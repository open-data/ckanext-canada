Government of Canada CKAN Extension - Extension Ã  CKAN du Gouvernement du Canada

Team: Ian Ward, Ross Thompson, Peder Jakobsen, Denis Zgonjanin

Features:

* Forms and Validation for GoC Metadata Schema (in progress)
* Batch import of data

Installation:

* Use CKAN Version: 2.0+
* After every pull or fetch, use ``python setup.py develop`` just in case entry points have changed.

From a clean database you must run::

   paster canada create-vocabularies
   paster canada create-organizations

Once to create the tag vocabularies and organizations this extension requires
before loading any data.

Configuration: development.ini or production.ini
------------------------------------------------

The CKAN ini file needs the following plugins for the registry server::

   ckan.plugins = stats canada_forms canada_internal canada_public canada_package wet_theme

For the public server use only::

   ckan.plugins = stats canada_forms canada_public canada_package wet_theme

CKAN also needs to be able to find the licenses file for the license list
to be correctly populated::

   licenses_group_url = http://<ckan instance>/static/licenses.json

Users that don't belong to an Organization should not be allowed to create
datasets, without this setting the form will be presented but fail during
validation::

   ckan.auth.create_dataset_if_not_in_organization = false

We aren't using notification emails, so they need to be disabled::

   ckan.activity_streams_email_notifications = false


Configuration: who.ini
----------------------

The following lines need to be changed in ``[plugin:friendlyform]``::

   -post_login_url = /user/logged_in
   -post_logout_url = /user/logged_out
   +post_login_url =
   +post_logout_url =



Loading Data
------------

These are the steps we use to import data faster during development.
Choose the ones you like, there are no dependencies.

1. use the latest version of ckan from the
   `canada-v2.0 branch <https://github.com/open-data/ckan/tree/canada-v2.0>`_
   for fixes related to importing tags (~30% faster)

2. disable solr updates while importing with the following lines in your
   development.ini (~15% faster)::

     ckan.search.automatic_indexing = false
     ckan.search.solr_commit = false

   With this change you need to remember to run
   ``paster --plugin ckan search-index rebuild`` (or ``rebuild_fast``)
   after the import, and remove the changes to development.ini.

3. Drop the indexes on the database while importing (~40% faster)

   Apply the changes in ``tuning/contraints.sql`` and
   ``tuning/what_to_alter.sql`` to your database.

4. Do the import in parallel with the load-datasets command (close to linear
   scaling until you hit cpu or disk I/O limits):

   For example load 150K records from "nrcan-1.jl" in parallel with three
   processes::

     paster canada load-datasets nrcan-1.jl 0 150000 -p 3

For UI testing, simply load the 50 test datasets from the data folder.  It contains a mixture of the latest version of assorted datasets from NRCAN and the Enviroment Canada Pilot::

   paster canada load-datasets data/sample.jl


Working with the API
--------------------

To view a raw dataset using the api, pipe your curl requests to python's mjson.tool to ensure readable formatting of the output::

  curl http://localhost:5000/api/action/package_show -d '{"id": "0007a010-556d-4f83-bb8e-6e22dcc62e84"}' |  python -mjson.tool


schema_description
------------------

The GoC Metadata Schema is available within the plugin by importing::

   from ckanext.canada.metadata_schema import schema_description

It is also available within the jinja2 templates as the variable
``schema_description``.

The ``schema_description`` object contains attributes:

``dataset_fields``
  an ordered list of `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_ of fields
  available in a dataset

``resource_fields``
  an ordered list of `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_ of fields
  available in each resource in a dataset

``dataset_sections``
  a list of dataset fields grouped into sections, dicts with ``'name'``
  and ``'fields'`` keys, currently used to separate fields across the
  dataset creation pages and group the geo fields together

``dataset_field_by_id``
  a dict mapping dataset field ids to their
  `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_

``resource_field_by_id``
  a dict mapping resource field ids to their
  `descriptions <#field-descriptions>`_

``dataset_field_iter(include_existing=True, section=None)``
  returns a generator of (field id, language, field description) tuples
  where field ids generated includes ``*_fra`` fields.  both French
  and English versions of a field point use the same
  `field description <#field-descriptions>`_.
  language is ``'eng'``, ``'fra'`` or ``None`` for fields without
  separate language versions.
  ``include_existing=False`` would *exclude* standard CKAN fields and
  ``section`` may be used to limith the fields to the passed dataset
  section.

``resource_field_iter(include_existing=True)``
  returns a generator of (field id, language, field description) tuples
  where field ids generated includes ``*_fra`` fields.  both French
  and English versions of a field point use the same
  `field description <#field-descriptions>`_.
  language is ``'eng'``, ``'fra'`` or ``None`` for fields without
  separate language versions.
  ``include_existing=False`` would *exclude* standard CKAN fields.

``languages``
  ``['eng', 'fra']``, useful for keeping literal ``eng`` and ``fra``
  strings out of the source code

``vocabularies``
  a dict mapping CKAN tag vocabulary ids to their corresponding dataset
  field ids


Field Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dataset and resource field descriptions are dicts containing the following:

``'id'``
  the CKAN internal name for this field, e.g. ``"notes"``, ``"title"``, ...
  ; note that these do not include French versions of fields such as
  ``"notes_fra"``; if you need both language versions use the
  ``dataset_field_iter`` or ``resource_field_iter`` methods above

``'label'``
  ``{'eng': English field label, 'fra': French field label}``

``'description'``
  ``{'eng': English field description, 'fra': French field description}``

``'example'``
  ``{'eng': English example value, 'fra': French example value}``

``'existing'``
  ``True`` if this field exists in the default CKAN schema in at least
  one language, used by ``dataset_field_iter`` and ``resource_field_iter``
  to filter English fields when passed ``include_existing=False``

``'bilingual'``
  ``True`` if there are two separate versions of this field, one for
  English and one for French with ``"_fra"`` appended to the ``'id'``,
  ``False`` for fields that contain no language component or have both
  languages stored together in one field, e.g. choice fields

``'mandatory'``
  ``"all"`` if always required, ``"geo"`` if required for geo datasets,
  ``"raw"`` if required for raw datasets, ``None`` if not required

``'choices'``
  if this key exists then the user must select one of the choices
  in this list; the list contains dicts with the following:

  ``'eng'``
    English text for this choice to display to English users

  ``'fra'``
    French text for this choice to display to French users

  ``'key'``
    valid field value

  ``'id'``
    an id for this choice from the proposed choices list, if available

  ``'pilot_uuid'``
    correspongind UUID for this choice when importing pilot data

  ``'subject_ids'``
    topic_category choices only: this field contains a list of ids from the
    subject choices list that correspond to this topic_category choice

``'choices_by_pilot_uuid'``
  if ``'choices'`` exists then this will be a dict mapping pilot UUIDs
  to the choices dicts above

``'type'``
  one of the following values:

  ``'primary_key'``
    the id field

  ``'choice'``
    select one of the ``'choices'`` list above

  ``'calculated'``
    value determined by code in CKAN or this plugin, not for user-entry

  ``'fixed'``
    fixed value for all datasets, all datasets will use ``'example'`` value
    above

  ``'slug'``
    text suitable for use as part of a URL: lowercase Unicode characters and
    hyphens

  ``'text'``
    free-form text

  ``'tag_vocabulary'``
    allow selection of 0 or more values from ``'choices'`` list above

  ``'keywords'``
    free-form keywords in a string separated with commas; Unicode
    letter characters, hyphen (-) and single spaces between words are allowed

  ``'date'``
    iso8601 date: YYYY-MM-DD

  ``'boolean'``
    ``True`` or ``False`` (not strings, but strings are accepted when setting)

  ``'url'``
    fully qualified URL

  ``'integer'``
    integer value in base 10

  ``'image_url'``
    fully qualified URL to an image file (gif, png or jpg)

``'ui_options'``
  if present a list containing strings such as ``'disabled'`` or ``'hidden'``
  which affect the form presented to users entering datasets


Google Analytics Integration
----------------------------

`okfn/ckanext-googleanalytics <https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-googleanalytics>`_ is used for Google Analytics integration. 
Follow these steps to integrate:

1. $ pip install -e  git+https://github.com/okfn/ckanext-googleanalytics.git#egg=ckanext-googleanalytics

2. Edit your CKAN ini file to add the Google Analytics tracking parameters::

      googleanalytics.id = UA-1010101-1
      googleanalytics.account = Account name (i.e. data.gov.uk, see top level item at https://www.google.com/analytics)

3. To the list of installed extensions, add `googleanalytics`. For example::

      ckan.plugins = stats json_preview googleanalytics canada_public canada_internal canada_forms wet_theme

Compiling the updated French localization strings
-------------------------------------------------

1. The open-data/ckan repo, branch canada-v2.0 should contain the compiled localization file. But if it doesn't, you can compile like so::

   $ python setup.py compile_catalog --locale FR

2. If you are not running CKAN from source, you need to copy the compiled .mo file to your deploy environment::

   $cp ckan_source/ckan/i18n/fr/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.mo virtualenv/ckan/src/ckan/ckan/i18n/fr/LC_MESSAGES/ckan.mo
