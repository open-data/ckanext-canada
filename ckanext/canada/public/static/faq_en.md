# General Registry Information

## Why can’t I create an account?

The most common reason is duplicate accounts. If you tried to create an account and you receive this error message “That login name is not available”, it means you already have an account with this username, but you either forgot or you are not certain it was already created. If you remember the password, try to log into the Registry using the same username and password. If you forgot the password, refer to the Reset your Password function, and a new one will be emailed to you. For any other reasons, ask for assistance via e-mail to open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca.

## Have you forgotten your password?
If you failed to login to the Registry and received this error massage “Login failed. Bad username or password”, start by requesting a password reset following these steps:

1. Click the "**Forgotten your password?**" button. The “Reset Your Password” page is displayed. 
2. Enter your Username, Example: djohn, and click "**[Request Reset](http://registry.open.canada.ca/en/user/reset)**" button.  
3. If you receive the error message “No such user: djohn”, it means your Username is incorrect and you should e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for assistance.
4. If you receive the message “Please check your inbox for a reset code”, check your e-mail inbox and open the e-mail received from the Registry.
5. Click the confirmation link included in the e-mail. The “Reset Your Password” page will then be displayed.
6. Enter a new password in both the “Password” and “Confirm” fields, then click "**Update Password**" button. Message “Your password has been reset” is displayed.
7. Login again using the new password. The message “{your name} is now logged in” will then be displayed.

## I can’t find my organization in the Registry?
There could be two possible reasons why you cannot find your organization in the registry:

1. The organization went through a name change recently; or
2. This is a new organization

In both cases, e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca  with your request, including the organization name.   

## What if I manage the registry for more than one organization?
You can use your Registry account to manage additional organizations. In order to do that, e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca  asking the support team to link your account to additional organizations, and include the organization names in the e-mail. 

## Why can’t I access the Registry?
There are a number of reasons why you cannot access the Open Government Registry. Try to answer the following questions and perform the proper correction actions. These questions will also be asked by the support team, if you contact them for help: 

1. Is the Registry indeed up and running? Can you see the “Open Government Registry” Login page? 
2. If you cannot see the Login page, did you use the proper link http://registry.open.canada.ca/en/? 
3. If it was a failed login using your new Username and Password, refer to [Forgot your password](http://registry.open.canada.ca/en/user/reset)? 

For any other access issues you could not resolve yourself, e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for assistance.

## Why am I getting a server error message?
This is a general error message indicating a problem the system cannot determine (usually a network or a communication issue). E-mail to open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for assistance, if this error persists.

## How do I change my Profile (i.e. password, name, e-mail)?
While you are logged into the Registry, follow these steps to change your Profile:

1. Click the "**My Account**" tab and select "**Edit Profile**". The “Change your Details” page is displayed. 
2. Enter your changes. However, it is not recommended to change your Username because you will lose the link to your uploaded data.
3. Once you completed your changes, click "**Update Profile**". You may want to Login again, depending on the changes you made.

## I have a question that does not appear on this page?
For any other questions that you cannot find in the page, e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca  for assistance.

# Open Data and Open Information

## How do I add an open data or open information record?
To add an open data or open information record to the Open Government Portal, you must create a metadata record for that dataset and add it to the Registry. To add a metadata record:

1. Review the instructions outlined in the ‘Open Government Registry Guide’
2. Click 'Add Open Data' or ‘Add Open Information’,
3. Fill out the required metadata elements,
4. Select ‘Yes’ for ‘IMSO Approval’ and ‘Ready to Publish’ as appropriate
5. Inform the open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca mailbox that you are ready for your record to be published on the Open Government Portal.

## How do I review an open data or open information record department or agency?
To review your department’s open data or open information records or to see the complete list of records, click **‘Organization’ in the main menu, and then find your organization**. 

## How do I search the Registry?
Use Search to find metadata records published in the Registry. This feature is the same as Advanced Search on the Open Government Portal. The Search page can be retrieved by selecting ‘Search’ in the main menu. Then enter a search term, or use the facets on the right hand side to narrow your search. Note, the list of results shows records matching your search query in the order in which they were entered or updated in the Registry (chronological).

## How do I browse the Registry?
Use the Browse feature to find metadata records published in the Registry. This feature is similar to Browse on the Open Government Portal website.
You can browse the Registry in three ways:

1. **By department.** Click on a department or agency name to see all records published by that organization.
2. **By subject.** Click on a subject to find all records 'tagged' with that subject.
3. **By format.** Click on a format name to find all records in that format.

The list of results displays records in the order in which they were entered or updated in the Registry (chronological).

# Proactive Disclosure Information

## How do I add, modify or delete records in the Registry?
If you need to add, modify or delete line items for proactive disclosure or ATI requests, please refer to the training guides on our [Proactive Disclosure GCpedia page](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Proactive_Disclosure_on_Open.Canada.ca). 

## How do I know what data and formats to populate the templates with?
You can download all the Data Element Profiles for each proactive disclosure type from our [Proactive Disclosure GCpedia page](http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Proactive_Disclosure_on_Open.Canada.ca).

## Why won’t the system upload my data?
There are many reasons why you could not upload Proactive Disclosure data to the Registry. Before uploading, make sure your data is prepared according to the following directives:

1. Always download the latest template from the Registry for each data upload,
2. Prepare your data in the proper template for a given organization and Proactive Disclosure type, 
3. The abbreviated name of the organization, i.e. aandc-aadnc, must stay in cell C1 of the template, as downloaded. This a key info for the system to identify the uploaded template,
4. Make sure the template to be uploaded has all the required fields for this Proactive Disclosure Type,
5. Enter only valid data in the template,
6. Your completed data template must be an Excel spreadsheet of the XLS or XLSX format.
7. Ensure that you do not rename the file. The system requires the Unique ID that is applied to each template. This ID is the file name applied to the template in the system. If you rename it, you will experience issues.

If you were not able to successfully upload your template, and an error message was displayed, check the message text and perform the correction measures.

If the upload was successful, but you do not see the data in the “Preview” portion of the page, verify your data file before attempting again. It could be a duplicate upload, among other reasons.

For any other issues you cannot resolve yourself, e-mail to open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca for assistance.

## Why can’t I see my uploaded data on the portal?
When you upload your completed template, you can preview the uploaded data in to bottom of the page immediately after you click **Submit**. However, the data will not be published to the Open Government Portal until the next day. A script runs overnight to automatically publish your report to the Open Government Portal. 

## Why does the ATI Disposition field require both English and French text?
Although it would have been ideal to develop a controlled vocabulary for this element, it was not feasible. Therefore, in the interim we will capture these elements in both English and French until we are able to develop a controlled list. 

## What is the order of Proactive Disclosure data displayed on the portal?
The default sort order of the Proactive Disclosure submissions, on the Open Information page, is the Date published in descending order. This means brings the latest submissions will be listed at the top of the page.  

## Why don’t I see any data in the preview of the registry?
This could be a browser issue that can be resolved by turning on ‘Compatibility View’. Ask your IT Support for help with this issue. It could also be an error encountered during upload. Please ensure that valid data and template format are prepared and uploaded to the Registry by referring to "[Why won’t the system upload my data?](#_Why_won’t_the)".

## What am I seeing in the preview screen? 
The preview in the registry always displays the latest 500 records for that organization and Proactive Disclosure type. If this is not the case, e-mail open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca  for assistance. 

## Was everything uploaded correctly?
This question is often asked because the data is not immediately pushed to the portal for you to confirm. The following are two possible methods for you to verify your data upload:

1. If you see the message “Your template has been successfully uploaded” after you have hit the ‘Submit’ button, you can verify the data by looking in the Preview table for one or more of your template line items; or
2. You can wait until the next morning to verify that the data was published on the Open Government Portal, since your data will be published overnight. 

## Why didn’t I get a confirmation email that my upload was successful? 
The system only provides an onscreen message (“Your template has been successfully uploaded”); it does not send a confirmation email. 

## Why don’t I see the upload button?
The upload button is available only to users who are associated with an organization and there are two reasons why the “Upload” button is not available:

1. Your Organization needs to be linked to your account before you can upload data. When you create (register) for your account, the system automatically sends an e-mail to the Account Management team, who will manually perform this link.
2. If you want to manage additional organizations, refer to “[What if I manage the registry for more than one organization?](#_What_if_I)”  in order to link those organizations to your account.
3. You may not be logged into the Registry.

## Are we still required to post our Proactive Disclosure data on our site?
Once you begin using the registry to upload the Proactive Disclosure data to the registry, you can stop publishing them to your institutional page, should you choose. Some organizations are providing a link to the open.canada portal from their institutional page for all proactive disclosures point forward. This will not be an issue once all organizations have migrated their historical data to the open.canada portal.

## Why doesn’t all the text I entered in the template appear?
Excel has a cell display limit of 1024 characters. This means no matter how much text you paste in the cell, it will only show the first 1024 characters. However, the complete text (or the first 32767 characters of it) is actually in the cell. You just have to extend the cell size, or put the cell in Edit mode, or look into the Formula bar, in order to see the complete text. 

## When can I start uploading Proactive Disclosure data? 
The Proactive Disclosure Registry is now live and ready to use. However, the mandatory migration for departments to onboard to the new system will occur in phases and follow each institutions web renewal migration and onboarding plan. 

## Who approves the proactive disclosure data?
There is no approval process. It is the organization’s responsibility to verify and approve proactive disclosure data before uploading to the Registry.
