Ensure the format_type attribute of Recombinant table fields is properly translated and displayed in the following areas for Proactive Disclosures (PD):
- Reference tab on individual PD pages
- Data dictionary for each PD
- Resource page of combined PDs

This addresses currently missing translations and improves consistency across PD-related interfaces.
